Description: We give the point estimators of a Poisson GLMM model with random intercept 
type of random effects, using maximum likelihood based methods. The linear predictor is 
related to the conditional mean of the response through the log link function. The random effect 
structure to be considered are either grouping effect or repeat measurement. 

After fitting the model, we use bootstrap to conduct inference, like approximate the 
sampling distribution of parameters and give the confidence intervals.
